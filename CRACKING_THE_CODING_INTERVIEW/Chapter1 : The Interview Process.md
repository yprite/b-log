# Chapter 1 : The Interview Process

- Algorithm and coding problems form the largest component of the interview process.
- Think of these as problem-solving questions.
- A numeric score might be assigned to your performance, but itâ€™s not actually a quantitative assessment.
- Rather, your interviewer will make an assessment of your performance, usually based on the following.

### Why?

This is one of the most common questions candidates have as they get started with this process. Why do things this way?

1. Lots of great candidates don't do well in these sorts of interviews.
2. You could look up the answer if did ever come up.
3. You rarely have to use data structures such as binary search trees in the real world. If you did need to, you could surely learn it
4. Whiteboard coding is an artificial environment. You would never code on the whiteboard in the real world, obviously.

It helps offer a little insight into the interviewer's mind set.


#### False negatives are acceptable.
- From the company's perspective, it's actually acceptable that some good candidates are rejected.
- They're far more concerned with false positives : people who do well in an interview but are not in fact very good.

#### Problem-solving skills are valuable.
- It's not the noly thing that matters, of course, but it is a really good thing.


#### Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful.
- Could you learn it as needed? Sure. But it's very difficult to know that you should use a binary search tree if you don't know of its existence. 
- And if you do know of its existence, then you pretty much know the basics.
- When enough candidates know theses basics, it's easy to get into a pattern of asking question with them.
