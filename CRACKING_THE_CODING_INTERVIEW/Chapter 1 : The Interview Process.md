# Chapter 1 : The Interview Process

- Algorithm and coding problems form the largest component of the interview process.
- Think of these as problem-solving questions.
- A numeric score might be assigned to your performance, but itâ€™s not actually a quantitative assessment.
- Rather, your interviewer will make an assessment of your performance, usually based on the following.
- 
--- 

### Why?

This is one of the most common questions candidates have as they get started with this process. Why do things this way?

1. Lots of great candidates don't do well in these sorts of interviews.
2. You could look up the answer if did ever come up.
3. You rarely have to use data structures such as binary search trees in the real world. If you did need to, you could surely learn it
4. Whiteboard coding is an artificial environment. You would never code on the whiteboard in the real world, obviously.

It helps offer a little insight into the interviewer's mind set.


#### False negatives are acceptable.
- From the company's perspective, it's actually acceptable that some good candidates are rejected.
- They're far more concerned with false positives : people who do well in an interview but are not in fact very good.

#### Problem-solving skills are valuable.
- It's not the noly thing that matters, of course, but it is a really good thing.

#### Basic data structure and algorithm knowledge is useful.
- Could you learn it as needed? Sure. But it's very difficult to know that you should use a binary search tree if you don't know of its existence. 
- And if you do know of its existence, then you pretty much know the basics.
- When enough candidates know theses basics, it's easy to get into a pattern of asking question with them.

#### Whiteboards let you focus on what matters
- You don't have a compiler, so you don't make your code compile.
- Whiteboards also tend to encourage candidates to speak more and explain their thought process.

#### But it's not for everyone or every company or every situation.
- It is what it is, so let's do the best we can with it.
  

#### How question are Selected.
- Just asking this question reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of where questinos come from.
- There are no lists of what interviews shoud ask.

#### It's All Relative.
- Interveiwers access you relative to other candidates on that same question by the same interviewer.
- Getting a hard questions is not a bad thing.
- When it's harder for you, it's harder for everyone.

#### Frequently Asked Questions.
- I didn't hear back immediatley after my inerview. Am i rejected?
  - No. There are a number of reasons why a company's decision might be delayed.
  - check in politely with your recruiter.
- Can I re-apply to a company after getting rejected?
  - Lots of people get rejected from Google or Microsoft and later get offers from them.
